## 📋 Overview

This project simulates UAV (drone)-based traffic monitoring and evaluates **energy consumption optimization** using **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**.  
It is based on the research paper *“Energy Consumption Optimization of UAV-Assisted Traffic Monitoring Scheme With Tiny Reinforcement Learning” (IEEE IoT Journal, 2024)*.

The implementation models:

- Highway traffic monitoring with multiple UAVs  
- **Flight and hover energy consumption** using physical models  
- **Multi-agent coordination** via MADDPG  
- **Lightweight model pruning** in Tiny-MAUP for deployment efficiency  
- **Comparative analysis** with baseline algorithms (DDPG and Random Policy)

## 🔬 Algorithms Implemented

### 🧠 MAUP (Multi-Agent UAV Path Planning)
- Based on **MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**
- Centralized training, decentralized execution
- UAVs cooperatively learn energy-efficient flight strategies
- Each agent optimizes:
  - Flight direction (ω)
  - Flight distance (d)
- Reward inversely proportional to energy consumption  
  \[
  R_i = \begin{cases}
  P_1, & \text{if UAV flies outside mission zone} \\
  \frac{1}{E_j(t)}, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]

### ⚡ Tiny-MAUP (Optimized Lightweight Variant)
- Reduces neurons in hidden layers (from 128 → 16)
- Applies **L1 norm pruning** for low-weight connections
- Achieves significant reduction in:
  - Computation cost  
  - Memory usage  
  - Energy consumption during model inference  
- Retains near-identical convergence performance compared to full MAUP

## ⚙️ System Model

- **Scenario**: UAVs monitor a fixed-length highway region  
- **Altitude**: 50 m (constant for all UAVs)  
- **Energy Components**:
  - Flight energy (proportional to velocity and drag)
  - Hover energy (constant)
  - Communication energy (transmission with base station)
- **Objective**:  
  Minimize total UAV energy consumption  
  \[
  \min \sum_{j=1}^M E_j \quad
  s.t. \; \text{flight & boundary constraints}
  \]
